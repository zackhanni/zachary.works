## About me

### Introduction

Hi, my name is Zack Hanni. I have been a programmer for the past 9 years

I've specialized in front-end development, but over the last few years I have actively branched out to full stack and mobile app development.

### Professional Experience

In the beginning, worked on a lot of freelance projects, but really started my career at Sounds Like Soma - a philly based recording studio -

where I worked with recording artist, and record labels to make promotional websites.

I also managed the studio's business website and IT infrastructure.

### Now

Now, im working at a Philadelphia based PR firm, SmartMark, which has allowed me to work on projects with a wider reach and a larger team to bounce ideas off of.

I build a lot of promotional websites and sign up pages focusing on energy and IOT technologies for large brands like Samsung, GE, and several state utility companies.

### Notable Projects and Achievements

One recent achievement in the last month, was releasing a mobile app on iOS and Android in collaboration with the Chicago zoo. - Which was exciting for me and the team.

### Current Situation and Future Goals

In the next 5 years I would love to be a full stack software engineer who is able to work remotely and travel. Im learning Japanese and have goals to live there a few months out of the year with my wife Emily,
